# Redux Bank Project ðŸ’¥

<br />

## Description ðŸ’¬

This React application utilizes Redux for state management and renders different components based on the user's state. If the fullName property in the Redux store is empty, the app displays the CreateCustomer component, allowing users to set up their account. Once the fullName is provided, the app presents the Customer, AccountOperations, and BalanceDisplay components. This setup ensures that users can first create their account and then access account management features and view their balance.
